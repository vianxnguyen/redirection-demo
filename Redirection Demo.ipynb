    "This notebook demonstrates our redirection framework introduced this paper: **Taking a turn for the better: Conversation redirection throughout the course of mental-health therapy.** In the paper, we define redirection as the extent to which speakers shift the immediate focus of the conversation and applied our measure in the context of long-term messaging therapy. In this demo, we provide an initial exploration into how our redirection framework can be applied in other domains in particular to a publicly available dataset of U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2020). Although court proceedings differ from therapy in terms of topics, goals, and interaction styles, their relatively unstructured and dynamic nature enables an initial exploration of how such discussions are redirected.\n",

    "In this setting, we focus on the interactions between justices and lawyers. The power dynamics between these distinct roles reflect the asymmetric relationship between therapists and patients in mental-health domains, where one party generally holds more influence over the conversation."

      "Suppose -- and I -- and I give one I -- I mentioned a moment ago.\n",
      "Suppose in the Atlantic contract, that's the other contract, these parties had a fixed contract for 25 years at a fixed price, no escalation clause, no agreement to agree clause, nothing like that in it, just a straight fixed price.\n",
      "And in 1954, the seller went to Atlantic and said, “Look, I think this price is too low.\n",
      "Let's see if we can do something about it.\n",
      "Let's see if we can agree upon a new price for it.”\n",
      "So they negotiated and they haggled back and fourth and they finally agreed upon a new price, and they entered into a letter agreement.\n",
      "Now, that, Your Honor, I submit, would be entry into a contract dealing with natural gas within the prescribed area at a higher price, and I think that would have activated our clause.\n",
      "Let me try to give another example that might demonstrate what I'm -- I'm trying to say, and I think in part may answer what petitioner said with reference to this other contract covering these various elements of quality and quantity.\n",
      "Now, let us suppose that in 1954, when the pipeline and Atlantic made this letter of agreement, suppose after they have agreed upon that new price of 12.5 cents, instead of merely writing a letter and saying -- and signing the letter, supposed they had said, “Well, this whole agreement is -- is dirty or torn up.”\n",
      "But for reasons of their own they said, “Let's just reproduce the old contract word for word for word except this new price we've agreed upon.”\n",
      "Now, that would have contained each and every one of those elements.\n",
      "And if you will then concede that that meets the Shell clause, and unless you are going to permit form to govern over substance, that's precisely what they did in 1954 when the pipeline and the Atlantic, after these extensive negotiations, just entered into a letter confirming their contract.\n",
      "We submit, Your Honors, that when the petitioner say there are only two types of these escalation clauses, if -- if I understand their position correctly, they say the Shell clause is a so-called “new” or “future type” of clause, and it can only be activated when the pipeline goes out and enters into a new contract covering a new supply of gas.\n",
      "As I understand that, they say every one of these clauses is either one extreme, that is it applies to every higher price or it's the other extreme where it applies only when the pipeline goes out and buys a new supply of gas.\n",
      "That, Your Honors, would leave no middle ground, no in-between ground.\n",
      "Suppose parties want to make another agreement like the Shell clause, here, Shell was not interested in its price increasing when the price increased to the pipeline under these fixed step-up clauses in a preexisting contract.\n",
      "Shell and the pipeline had made their own bargain in that regard.\n",
      "But certainly, parties are to be able to make other contracts.\n",
      "We submit the Commission's conclusion and the petitioners' position here would leave no middle ground on that.\n",
      "One other thing in connection with those clauses, I would like to point out that this record shows that at the time of the Shell contract in 1951, the pipeline was also the purchaser under the neighboring Atlantic contract.\n",
      "Now, as the purchaser under that contract, that pipeline certainly knew of this clause in the Atlantic contract which was an agreement to agree clause.\n",
      "And certainly, it was not a price redetermination clause as the petitioners indicated.\n",
      "The party said they would agree upon price.\n",
      "All price would be fixed by arbitration.\n",
      "But at any rate, the pipeline certainly knew of that clause at the time it, the pipeline, prepared the Shell clause.\n",
      "Under those circumstances, isn't it reasonable to assume that if the pipeline did not want its price to increase when the Atlantic price went up under that agreement to agree clause, it would have said so.\n",
      "Another fact that we think of extreme significance in this case is this.\n",
      "It's stated in the briefs of the Government and of the pipeline that it's very strongly to the benefit of the pipeline to limit these “favored-nation” clauses as much as they possibly can.\n",
      "And I can't again say that.\n",
      "Maybe it is.\n",
      "It's also shown in this record that the pipeline prepared this clause.\n",
      "It is further shown in this record at the time the pipeline prepared this clause, it was the purchaser under the Atlantic agreement.\n",
      "Now, if it had been the intention of the parties at that time in 1951 to limit this Shell clause, and if the limitation of the Shell clause in that regard was so all important to that pipeline, and since that pipeline prepared that clause, isn't it reasonable to assume that it would have done what some other pipelines have done and made it clear that the Shell price would not increase except when the pipeline bought new gas under a new supply contract.\n",
      "Now, Your Honors, we have shown in our brief a typical contract at page 33, near the bottom of page 33 of the Shell brief and some hearings on the Harris Bill which was to amend the Natural Gas Act in 1955.\n",
      "There is shown there a “favored-nation” clause.\n",
      "And I would just like to read two or three lines from that.\n",
      "Your Honors can -- can follow it because it shown as 3A down at the bottom of that page.\n",
      "“Buyer agrees that if during the term of this contract, it purchases from producers new gas from new sources of supply,” and then it goes on, “in a given area that it will give the same price to the seller”.\n",
      "Under the circumstances of this case, we respectfully submit, Your Honor, had that been the intention of the parties when the pipeline prepared the clause, it certainly would have used language along that line, perhaps not that specific language. \n",
      "\n",
      "That was put in at my request.\n",
      "That's the one thing he gave me on the findings.\n",
      "As I said that's the only reference in all these findings which were prepared in the first sentence by the laborers to the Central Agency Plan.\n",
      "Now I would suggest to Mr. Justice Black to what Judge Perry did was answer the question which I thought you would put me by saying, \"Well even if it's true that the purpose and effect of the Central -- of the strike, of the demand was to -- was to frustrate the Central Agency Plan and to frustrate the Section 6 notice, it's irrelevant.\n",
      "The Court of Appeals simply disagreed with his -- his conclusion on that.\n",
      "They found that it was highly irrelevant that this strike, this contract demand had been aimed at the Central Agency Plan.\n",
      "It was designed to frustrate an operation.\n",
      "Therefore when we talk about what the Court of Appeals did to his findings, they simply said his whole theory of -- of regarding those facts is irrelevant was wrong.\n",
      "They were highly relevant. \n",

      "-- but -- but the connection -- the connection supplies the about 64 % of the traffic that Western gets.\n",
      "That is the connection over here in the east with Pennsylvania and on the west with Santa Fe.\n",
      "And those connections I should say came about -- and that traffic came about through the genius of a man now dead, George McNear and perhaps this would be a good spot Mr. Chief Justice to indicate how all these came about.\n",
      "For 33 years, the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Burlington which is another huge western carrier, owned the western property jointly, each owned 50%.\n",
      "And the interest of those two carriers in the longer haul competing gateways was such that this gateway dried up and Western went into receivership where it languished for 10 years.\n",
      "And then it was bought as two strips of west if you please by this man McNear who advised the Commission of the time he made the application to acquire the property that this railroad could never prosper as long as it was -- was in the control of the carriers with whom it had to compete and that was the situation with the Pennsylvania and the Burlington and he demonstrated that very graphically.\n",
      "He bought the property in 1927.\n",
      "In less than two years, the car loadings went from 38,000 to 68,000 and I might say while the Commission says that there is time at least a time relation between the connection at Lomax with the Santa Fe, and the successive Western, it does not appear in the figures or in the facts, there may be a time connection but no factual connection.\n",
      "Of that 68,000 cars, less than 6000 cars came at that connection and at the same time some Burlington traffic was lost because when that connection was made, the Burlington connection at this point was broken leaving only two other connections with Burlington.\n",
      "So the 6000 figure is not a net figure and even that is very small in relation to the total picture.\n",
      "The undisputed fact is and the Commission found that the Pennsylvania and the Santa Fe have offered passive resistance and that's an interesting term because we -- we've come to the language problem in that connection presently.\n",
      "I was interested in hearing the opinions of the Court this morning with respect to differences in the use of language that we -- we find that at least two of the railroads in this case had special language of their own and one of the aspects of that special language is this passive resistance.\n",
      "It didn't counter-solicit as they said but they tried to get the business themselves through the St. Louis gateway first for Pennsylvania, Chicago gateway second and through the Chicago gateway for the Santa Fe. \n",

      "Page 30 about half or three quarters of the way down.\n",
      "The Court said, is it probable that a person of the weight of the plaintiff falling 15 feet to a flat surface would likewise have fractures?\n",
      "His answer - falling 15 feet, question.\n",
      "yes, on a flat surface, question; on a flat surface?\n",
      "Yes then he says I couldn't necessarily say the second metatarsal, but I would say fracture would be very probable.\n",
      "Now then over at the next page in the middle of 31, question; the other fracture would have been about the same?\n",
      "Answer, the usual fracture that occurs in a straight fall on that height is one of the os calcis of the heel bone.\n",
      "With fall at obliquity the force is moved forward such that the fracture would occur in the metatarsal.\n",
      "So that the only effect of the -- the right of away being slanted instead of being flat was that he broke his metatarsal instead of his heel and the heel was a much more serious bone to break than the metatarsal.\n",
      "As to the -- as to the negligence of the employees or as to the inadequacy of the workforce I simply state that they were not engaged in anything that the plaintiff was doing at time of his fall.\n",
      "Nothing they did, nothing they didn't do, had anything to with his falling off the ladder and the plaintiff relies simply on the fact that he was on top of the box car whereas he might not have been if he had had a greater number of brakemen and they had been more experienced.\n",
      "The answer to that question is fully answered in the case of Atlantic Coast Line against Reynolds which case would have to be overruled by this Court if -- if the Court rules that there was a jury question in this present action on the inadequacy and insufficiency of the number of brakemen in the case of -- \n",
      "\n",
      "May I say in answer to that question, Mr. Justice that we believe that while -- there was no participation.\n",
      "We agree there was no participation by the federal officers the time Officer Beckmann and Grace approached this cab.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, if Officer Beckmann, and this was relevance to any suggestion that there was any -- that there was the danger bungling state officers interfering with federal prosecutions when they well asked if Officer Beckmann and Grace had never made the search and seizure and turn this evidence over to the federal authorities, how in the world can we assume that there would have been a federal prosecution.\n",
      "Now, when they came to the federal authorities, we quite frankly believe that with the federal authorities should quite properly have done.\n",
      "And if the Court decides this case, as we are urging it to be decided, would do would be to say having obtained this evidence unlawfully, we cannot -- we will not land our aid and neither can we invoke the aid of the federal courts. \n",
